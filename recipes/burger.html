    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are the ultimate steakhouse burgers. 
        They are packed with flavor and reliably 
        juicy, even when cooked to well-done.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pieces white sandwich bread, crusts removed and cut into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>2-1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>3 pounds 80 to 85% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>8 hamburger buns</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mash the bread and milk together with a fork until 
            it forms a chunky paste. Add the salt, pepper, garlic, Worcestershire 
            sauce and ketchup and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and scallions and break the meat up with your hands. 
            Mix everything together until evenly combined. Divide the mixture into 8 equal 
            portions and form compact balls. Flatten the balls into 3/4-inch patties about 4-1/2 
            inches across. Form a slight depression in the center of each patty to prevent the burgers 
            from puffing up on the grill.</li>
        <li>Oil the grilling grates. Grill the burgers, covered, until nicely browned on the first side, 
            2 to 4 minutes. Flip burgers and continue cooking for a few minutes more until desired 
            doneness is reached. Before serving, toast the buns on the cooler side of the grill if desired.</li>
    </ol>
